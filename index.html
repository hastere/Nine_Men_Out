        <h1>About</h1>
        Sports gambling is not allowed in 48 states, but many choose to set up casual side bets of their own.
        The aim of Nine Men Out is to help users who might not be able to visit a casino or bookie to place a bet on a sports game.
        Users will be able to bet points on various measures of sports games, such as point spread or the over/under on points scored.
      </p>
