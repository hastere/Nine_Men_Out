# Nine Men Out
The peer-to-peer sports betting app for CS495.

## Importance
Sports gambling is not allowed in 48 states, but many choose to set up casual side bets of their own. The aim of Nine Men Out is to help users who might not be able to visit a casino or bookie to place a bet on a sports game. Users will be able to bet points on various measures of sports games, such as point spread or the over/under on points scored. 

## Functionality Goals
- Users will be able to look at their personal profile to see what bets they have made, and how many points they have made off of their bets. 
- Users can browse a list of sports and their respective leagues, and view the odds for games. 
- Users can submit bets on games, or chose to take an existing bet made by another user. 
- Users can add friends, enabling social features such as sending direct bets to a user.
